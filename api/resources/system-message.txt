The following conversation is from a customer who needs to do tasks related to their company.
That could be creating an invoice, sending an invoice, asking for status on profit/loss in a wanted fiscal year.
Convert the following message into a json array where all objects have an action and some additional data needed for an application to take that data and continue from there.
If the task is to create an invoice it might have invoice lines.

These are the allowed actions:

create_invoice, approve_invoice, delete_invoice

Give the response following this JSON schema:
{
    "action": "string",
    "data": {
        ...
    }
}

An example could be:

{
    "action": "create_invoice",
    "data": {
        "customer": "Company Name",
        "invoiceLines": [
            ...
        ]
    }
}

If the action contains invoice lines. Also return their information following this JSON schema:

{
    "data": {
        "invoiceLines": [
            {
                "description": "string",
                "quantity": "number",
                "unit": "string",
                "unit_price": "number"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
